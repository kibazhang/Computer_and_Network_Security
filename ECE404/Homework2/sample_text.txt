A technology that constantly changes website code to defeat hackers has been unveiled by an US startup.Shape Security says its product transforms a website code into a moving target to prevent cybercriminals from carrying out scripted attacks. Shape describes its product as being a barrier against automated software tools known as bots that recognise and exploit vulnerabilities in the website code. Many products try to prevent such breaches by identifying bots by their signatures and the internet and email addresses they send data to. Hackers have tried to counter detection by using a technique called real time polymorphism by making their bots rewrite their own code every time they infect a new machine to make them harder to recognise. Shape says its product reverses this advantage. The website looks and feels exactly the same to legitimate users, but the underlying site code is different on every page view.
